# Simple folder structure Node.js (Express.js)

When developing a Node.js application using Express.js, structuring your codebase effectively is crucial for maintainability, scalability, and ease of collaboration. A well-organized project structure allows you to manage complexity, making it easier to navigate and understand the code. In this repo, we'll explore a typical folder structure for an Express.js application and explain the purpose of each directory and file.

## Project Structure Overview

Here’s a common folder structure for an Express.js application:

Explanation of Each Directory and File:

- **`app.js`**: The main entry point of the application. This is where you initialize the Express app, set up middleware, define routes, and start the server. Think of it as the control center of your web application. Optionally, you can name it server.js or index.js.

- **`bin/`**: The bin directory contains server startup scripts. For example, the www file is typically used to start the Express server and can include environment variable setup for different environments (development, production).

- **`config/`**: This directory stores configuration files for your application, such as database connections, server settings, and environment-specific configurations (e.g., development.js, production.js). It helps separate sensitive configuration from the app's core logic.

- **`controllers/`**: Controllers handle incoming requests and generate responses. Each file typically corresponds to a specific part of your application (e.g., userController.js for managing user-related routes).

- **`middleware/`**: Middleware functions that intercept requests before they reach the controllers. Common middleware tasks include authentication, logging, request validation, etc.

- **`models/`**: Models define the structure of your data and interact with the database. Each file represents a data entity (e.g., User.js) and handles CRUD operations for that entity.

- **`routes/`**: The routes directory defines the application's endpoints and maps them to their respective controllers. Typically, you'll have different route files for different entities or features (e.g., userRoutes.js).

- **`public/`**: This directory contains static files (e.g., CSS, JavaScript, images) that are served directly to the client. Use express.static in your app.js to serve these files.

- **`views/`**: The views directory is for server-side rendering templates using a templating engine like EJS, Pug, or Handlebars. You may not need this directory if your application is strictly an API.

- **`tests/`**: The tests directory holds your test files to ensure the application functions correctly. It's good practice to separate tests into unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

- **`utils/`**: Utility functions that are used across the application. These functions typically perform common tasks like validation, formatting, or calculations and are kept separate for reusability.

- **`.env`**: This file contains environment variables for your application, such as database credentials or API keys. Using a package like dotenv, these variables can be securely loaded into your app.

- **`node_modules/`**: This directory contains all your project’s dependencies, managed by npm (or yarn). It’s automatically created when you run npm install and should be excluded from version control using .gitignore.

- **`README.md`**: A markdown file to document your project. It typically includes a description of the project, setup instructions, and other relevant details for developers or users.
